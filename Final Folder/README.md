## Target Audience

Our target audience for this project are fellow BIOL 364 students. Students in this class generally have had a brief introduction or previous exposure to R software. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to walk students though a data modeling tutorial, including basic R housekeeping, but not go extremely in-depth in the explanation for all coding language. This tutorial assumes the individual has some previous R experience. 

## Instructions

This tutorial will use an Iris data set to teach you how to load, explore, and analyze your data. This guided tutorial will walk you through the process, providing you with code examples to modify and run yourself. It provides explanations of code and tests to be run. Be sure to fill in any empty code chunks and places for your analysis and prompts.

Although the tutorial itself provides detailed instructions for how to complete the tutorial, to run the tutorial, please follow the instructions below:

1. Visit the public GITHub Repository (https://github.com/Bucknell-Biol364/Project_1_Group_1_2024.git)

2. Navigate to the "Final Folder".

3. Download "Project 1 Group 1 Tutorial - Final.RMD"

4. Open the RMD final in RStudio.

4. Begin the tutorial! (If you are unable to download the dataset with the code in the tutorial, it is also available to download in the "Final Folder")


## Objectives
1. Understand how to classify data (understanding different variable types and its effect on how to use them in analysis).
2. Review loading data, organizing data, and preparing data for statistical analysis.
3. Explain the conditions required for using linear modeling, t.tests, or ANOVA tests to analyze data. 


## Data 
Loaded data options in our group Project_1 repository on GitHub. We will review these during lab and select one for the tutorial.
