## Target Audience

Our target audience for this project are fellow BIOL 364 students. Students in this class generally have had a brief introduction or previous exposure to R software. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to walk students though a data modeling tutorial, including basic R housekeeping, but not go extremely in-depth in the explanation for all coding language. This tutorial assumes the individual has some previous R experience. 

## Instructions



## Objectives
