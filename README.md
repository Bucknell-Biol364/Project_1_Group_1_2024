## Target Audience

Our target audience for this project are fellow BIOL 364 students. Students in this class generally have had a brief introduction or previous exposure to R software. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to walk students though a data modeling tutorial, including basic R housekeeping, but not go extremely in-depth in the explanation for all coding language. This tutorial assumes the individual has some previous R experience. 

## Instructions



## Objectives
1. Understand how to classify data (understanding different variable types and its effect on how to use them in analysis).
2. Review loading data, organizing data, and preparing data for statistical analysis.
3. Explain the conditions required for using linear modeling, t.tests, or ANOVA tests to analyze data. 


## Data 
Loaded data options in our group Project_1 repository on GitHub. We will review these during lab and select one for the tutorial.


You will need to edit this README.md document when your tutorial is complete to include instructions for using the tutorial.
